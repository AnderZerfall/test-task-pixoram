Hello there! Hope you have a nice day!
I'm Anna or Fukuro. and I'm happy to present to you what I've created!

Small, simple and usable online shop based on React. Sounds fun and useful.

Let's dive into more details.

 ## Key features

- **Dynamic data download**
- **Smooth animations & loaders**: To improve UI, I added small cute animations and loaders.
- **State persisting between sessions**: Changed tab? Don't worry! Your progress will be fully recovered from sessionStorage.
- **Responsive design. Mobile first**: Displayed optimally both on mobiles and desktops
- **SCSS design**: Minimalistic design made by hand.
- **Add goods to your cart**: You can easily add goods to your cart and see the counter.
- **Optimization**: Say no to extra component rerenderings!
- **Error pages**: if something goes wrong, you'll quickly find the core of the issue with small error pages (Page not found, Data not found, Cart is empty)!

## Used Technologies
- **React 18**: The core of our project
- **TypeScript**: Our security card for safety development
- **Vite**: for building our project
- **SASS**: easy styling!
- **Prettier**: just some sprinkles to make our code readable.
- **Framer-motion**: for automatic animations.
